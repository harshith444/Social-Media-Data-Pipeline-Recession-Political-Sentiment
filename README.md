# Social-Media-Data-Pipeline-Recession-Political-Sentiment
This project builds an end-to-end ETL pipeline and analysis framework to study how people discuss economic recessions and political events across major social media platforms.

Over 500K+ comments were collected from Reddit, 4chan, YouTube, and r/politics in just one month, processed with NLP techniques, and visualized through an interactive dashboard to surface insights on sentiment and hate speech.

📊 Project Overview
	•	ETL & Data Collection
	•	Built an automated ETL pipeline that extracted 500K+ comments from Reddit, 4chan, and YouTube using official APIs.
	•	Transformed raw text by cleaning, handling noise (links, emojis, HTML), detecting languages, and normalizing for consistency.
	•	Loaded data into PostgreSQL, applying database normalization to reduce redundancy and ensure efficient querying.
	•	Orchestrated jobs with Apache Airflow, enabling 24/7 data collection and reliability.
	•	Data Analysis
	•	Applied NLP (NLTK, VADER) for sentiment/emotion classification (happy, sad, angry, sorrow).
	•	Integrated the ModerateHateSpeech API to detect toxic language with confidence thresholds.
	•	Key Findings:
	•	Recession discussions → 55% positive, 25% negative.
	•	4chan → 62% negative sentiment, highest among platforms.
	•	YouTube → more positive (37.5% positive).
	•	r/politics → 116K+ comments analyzed, ~90% non-toxic.
	•	Visualization
	•	Developed an interactive dashboard (Flask + PowerBI) with filters by platform and timeframe.
	•	Helped researchers compare sentiment/hate patterns across platforms, surfacing contrasts such as 4chan’s negativity vs YouTube’s optimism.

📈 Sample Insights
	•	Recession-related discussions were 55% positive, despite economic uncertainty.
	•	4chan hosted the most negative tone (62% negative) vs. YouTube’s higher positivity.
	•	Political discourse in r/politics showed 90% non-toxic comments, reflecting the impact of strong moderation.

🔮 Future Work
	•	Expand ETL to additional platforms (Twitter/X, TikTok).
	•	Train ML models for more advanced hate speech detection.
	•	Deploy dashboard online for public access.
